			<h1 style="text-align: center;">Business Side - Taco Truck</h1>
			<p>
			I grew up in a small business family and they own two taco trucks. Our company is simply called "The Taco Truck."
			The problem is the menu because I saw the customer struggle looking from the distance while in a waiting line.
			I created a new menu which is a poster instead of a A4 paper attached to the window. It is successful for customers 
			where they can see the menu better.			
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			I am an intermediate for Illustrator Adobe and Photoshop Adobe Software and I use it for business.
			I created a first menu using Illustrator and it was successful, but it needed more improvement.
			I recreated the second menu because the pictures were from internet. I wanted to make our own pictures.
			I took the pictures of our foods and edited them using Photoshop Adobe Software.
