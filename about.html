				<h1>About Me</h1>
				
				<p>
				<b>Introduction</b>
				Hello! I'm Kelvin, a UX/UI and Human-Centered Designer. Feel free to call me Kel or KOD, based on my initials. I earned my Bachelor of Science Degree in Human-Centered Computing (HCC) from the Rochester Institute of Technology.

				My focus areas and expertise lie in front-end development, accessibility, and psychology.

				<br>
				<b>About Myself -</b>
				I am deaf and proficient in American Sign Language (ASL) while also having some proficiency in British Sign Language (BSL). I learned basic signs in pre-kindergarten through Pidgin Sign English (PSE), and later acquired proficiency in American Sign Language during high school.

				I experienced hearing loss at the age of three due to a high fever and have been using hearing aids since then. At the age of twenty-three, I underwent cochlear implant surgery on my right ear. Currently, I wear a processor along with a hearing aid.

				In terms of hobbies, I enjoy cooking, practicing hot yoga, and engaging in circus activities such as contortion, acrobatics, and trapeze. I also like playing games on my personal computer and video games, as well as activities like walking, climbing, hiking, and spending time with my partner and friends. I am always open to trying new things.
