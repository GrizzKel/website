				<h1>About Me</h1>
				
				<p>
				<b>Introduction -</b>
				Hello! I am Kelvin, a human-centred computing major! You can call me Kel or KOD (initial names).
				I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology with a Human-Centred Computing (HCC) Bachelor of Science Degree.
				My concentrations are front-end development and accessibility.
				<br>
				Seeking a full-time job opportunity to work as a UI/UX designer, Usability Tester, 
				and/or UI developer. Seeking to develop systems that are accessible through desktop, 
				web, and mobile computing interfaces for users which benefit.  
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>About Myself -</b>
				I am deaf and I sign American and British Sign Language. I was born hearing and had hearing loss at three years old.
				I wore hearing aids since I was three years old, then I got my right ear cochlea implanted at twenty-three years old.
				I first learned basic signs in pre-kindergarten. It was Pidgin Sign English (PSE), then I learned American Sign Language in high school.

				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Hobbies -</b>
				I like cooking, doing hot yoga and circus (contortion, acrobat, trapeze, etc.), playing some games on my personal computer
				and video game, walking, climbing, hiking, and going out with friends. I am always up for something new.
